# Top-K Elements Pattern

## Overview
The Top-K Elements pattern uses heaps (priority queues) to efficiently find the k largest, smallest, or most frequent elements in a dataset. This pattern is essential for problems involving ranking, selection, and optimization.

## Key Concepts
- **Min-Heap**: Root contains minimum element, used for k largest elements
- **Max-Heap**: Root contains maximum element, used for k smallest elements
- **Heap Size**: Maintain heap of size k for memory efficiency
- **Frequency Analysis**: Combine with hash maps for frequency-based problems
- **Quick Select**: Alternative O(n) average approach for k-th element

## When to Use
- Finding k largest/smallest elements
- Top k frequent elements
- K closest points to origin
- Kth largest element in stream
- Merge k sorted arrays/lists
- Sliding window maximum/minimum
- Priority-based scheduling problems

## Time Complexity
- **Heap Operations**: O(log k) for insert/delete
- **Building Heap**: O(n log k) for n elements
- **Quick Select**: O(n) average, O(nÂ²) worst case
- **Space**: O(k) for heap storage

## Interview Tips
1. Choose between min-heap and max-heap based on problem requirements
2. Maintain heap of size k for memory efficiency
3. Consider Quick Select for better average time complexity
4. Use hash maps for frequency-based problems
5. Handle edge cases: k larger than array size, duplicate elements
6. Consider tie-breaking strategies for equal elements
7. Think about real-time updates and streaming data scenarios
