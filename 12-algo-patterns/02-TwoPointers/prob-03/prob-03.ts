/**
 * PROBLEM 3: SUBSEQUENCE COUNTING WITH TWO POINTERS
 * 
 * DIFFICULTY: Medium (FAANG Interview Level)
 * PATTERN: Two Pointers + String Matching
 * 
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] 
 * that is a subsequence of s.
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string 
 * with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order 
 * of the remaining characters.
 * 
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 * 
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * - 1 <= words.length <= 5000
 * - 1 <= words[i].length <= 50
 * - s and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters
 * 
 * EXAMPLES:
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Only "ahjpjau" and "ja" are subsequences of s.
 * 
 * APPROACH HINTS:
 * 1. Use two pointers for each word to check if it's a subsequence
 * 2. For each word, use one pointer for the word and one for the string s
 * 3. Advance both pointers when characters match, only string pointer when they don't
 * 4. Word is a subsequence if we reach the end of the word
 * 5. Consider optimization: preprocess s to create character position maps
 * 
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: O(s.length * words.length) for basic approach
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) for basic approach, O(s.length) for optimized

/**
 * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (for interview discussion):
 * 
 * 1. How would you handle the case where words can be very long?
 * 2. What if we need to find the actual subsequences, not just count them?
 * 3. How would you optimize for the case where many words share common prefixes?
 * 4. What if we need to support real-time queries (add/remove words dynamically)?
 * 5. How would you handle Unicode characters or case-insensitive matching?
 * 6. What if we need to find the longest common subsequence instead?
 * 7. How would you parallelize this algorithm for very large inputs?
 * 8. What if we need to support wildcard characters in the words?
